Better charts for Access with chart.js

Microsoft Access urgently needs modern charts. The original charts in MS Access are from the 90s of the previous century. Microsoft has given the charts in Access a lift. They call it "Mordern Charts".

There are many solutions for charts based on Java Script available on the web. This project makes use of this.
We create charts using the Chart.js library. We display these in the web browser control. We hide the whole logic in a class module.

Take a look at the demo and let yourself be inspired by the possibilities.
